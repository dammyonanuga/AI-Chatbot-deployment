An AI Chatbot done as a contract study project aimed at improving the University of Texas Permian Basin's website Chatbot 
## Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots have revolutionized the way businesses interact with their customers. They provide instant and personalized responses, making the customer experience seamless and efficient. In recent years, chatbots have gained immense popularity in the education sector, where they have become a valuable tool for universities to interact with students and provide them with information about various aspects of campus life.
This contract study proposes a developed AI chatbot for the University of Texas Permian Basin (UTPB) that assists students with academic and enrollment-related questions. In this project, the author aims to build a simpler version of the UTPB chatbot using Python, Flask API, Javascript, and an HTML/CSS template. The chatbot will be based on natural language processing (NLP) algorithms that can understand and interpret the intent of the user's questions.
The project involves various stages, including data gathering, data cleaning, training the machine learning models, and deploying the chatbot using Flaskâ€™s web-based interface. The author also evaluates the performance of the chatbot based on its accuracy, response time, and overall user experience.
The outcome of this project is a working prototype of an AI chatbot that can assist students with academic and enrollment-related questions. The chatbot will be able to provide quick and accurate responses to common queries, reducing the workload of the university staff and improving the overall student experience.
